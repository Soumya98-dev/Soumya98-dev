## About Me

I am a **Mobile & Web Engineer** with a unique dual background: **2+ years of global experience** merging enterprise scale (**Ex-Allianz**) with US product design standards (**Apple Developer Academy**).

I am currently relocating from the US back to the Indian tech ecosystem and am available to join **immediately**.

### What I Bring to the Table
* **Mobile Product Sense:** Architected and shipped **4 native iOS apps** to TestFlight, presenting safety architectures directly to **Apple Engineering Leadership**.
* **Enterprise Reliability:** Optimized financial systems at **Allianz**, sustaining **99.9% uptime** and reducing load times by **40%**.
* **Full-Stack Versatility:** Comfortable bridging the gap between backend logic (**Node.js/Spring Boot**) and fluid mobile interfaces (**SwiftUI**).

## The Story So Far

I had an unexpected love story with sodas and energy drinks! Back in India, I was the poster child for healthy choices. But after arriving in the USA, from late-night LeetCode grind sessions powered by **Celsius** to caffeine-fueled app brainstorming at the **Apple Developer Academy**, soda became my unofficial co-founder.

But there’s more to me than code. I’m a quiet observer who once struggled with stuttering, using that lens to connect more deeply with people today. I find peace in ambient music, have a soft spot for pink flowers (reminiscent of my mother's rooftop garden), and enjoy social impact discussions.

**Currently relocating back to India and looking for the next mission-driven team to join immediately.**
