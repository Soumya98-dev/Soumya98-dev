## Fun Fact

I had an unexpected love story with sodas and energy drinks! Back in my home country, I was the poster child for healthy choices; I wouldn’t touch a soda even if it came with free Wi-Fi. But after arriving in the USA, something changed. One sip of that fizzy, caffeinated magic, and boom; it was a full-blown affair. From late-night LeetCode grind sessions powered by Celsius and Diet Coke to caffeine-fueled app brainstorming at the Apple Developer Academy, it’s safe to say soda became my unofficial co-founder.

But there’s more to me than just code and carbonation. I’m a quiet observer who once struggled with stuttering, now using that lens to connect more deeply with people and ideas. I find beauty through photography, peace through ambient music, and purpose through social impact topics like feminism and women’s rights; subjects I care about deeply, even if they don’t trend in my peer group.

So yes, I came for the Master’s in Computer Science, stayed for the late-night Snickers, philosophical Reddit rabbit holes, and the belief that even in tech, empathy and equity matter. Life’s little plot twists; powered by pixels, principles, and the occasional cold brew.
