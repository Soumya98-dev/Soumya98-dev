## About Me

I am a **Full-Stack & iOS Engineer** with a unique dual background: **2+ years of experience** building high-availability enterprise systems (at **Allianz**) and specialized training in native mobile product development (**Apple Developer Academy**).

My core focus is delivering software that is both robust (**99.9% uptime**) and user-centric.

### What I Bring to the Table
* **Enterprise Reliability:** Optimized legacy dashboards (reducing load times by **40%**) and built real-time synchronization engines for workforce management.
* **Mobile Product Quality:** Architected and shipped **4 native iOS apps** to TestFlight, presenting safety solutions directly to Apple Engineering Leadership.
* **Full-Stack Versatility:** Comfortable moving across the stack, from **React/Node.js** backends to **SwiftUI** mobile interfaces.

### Current Status
Recent **MS CS Graduate** from Wayne State University (**GPA 3.66/4.0**).
**Open to Full-Stack and Mobile Engineering roles across the US** (Open to Relocation).

## Fun Fact & The Story So Far

I had an unexpected love story with sodas and energy drinks! Back in my home country, I was the poster child for healthy choices; I wouldn’t touch a soda even if it came with free Wi-Fi. But after arriving in the USA, something changed. From late-night LeetCode grind sessions powered by **Celsius** to caffeine-fueled app brainstorming at the Apple Developer Academy, it’s safe to say soda became my unofficial co-founder.

But there’s more to me than just code and carbonation. I’m a quiet observer who once struggled with stuttering, now using that lens to connect more deeply with people. I find beauty through photography, peace through ambient music, and purpose through social impact topics like feminism and women’s rights.

**I came for the Master’s in CS, stayed for the late-night Snickers, philosophical rabbit holes, and the belief that even in tech, empathy matters.**
