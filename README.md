# Hi there, I'm Soumyadeep Chatterjee! 👋

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Wayne State University in Detroit. I'm passionate about building software that can have a real-world impact, and I love solving challenging problems in the fields of software engineering, data science, and machine learning.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on expanding my skills in SwiftUI and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m learning more about large language models (LLMs) to incorporate them into a new project.
- 💬 Ask me about web development, data structures & algorithms, or anything tech-related.
- 🏫 Previous experience: I have experience working at Allianz, and I’ve been involved in several projects during my studies using ReactJs, Java, Python, MySQL, and MongoDB.
- 📷 In my free time, I enjoy photography and finding creative angles in the everyday.
